# Take-Care
High School Project iOS Application that gives the best recommendations and information you didnâ€™t know about breast cancer.

This app was a team final project in which I was in charge of programming the app. This app was intended to raise awareness about breast cancer 
and how to prevent depending on different aspects like obesity, age, alcohol consumption, etc. and giving recommendations based on your profile.
In this project I learned the basics for swift development and helped me develop more passion for technology.
